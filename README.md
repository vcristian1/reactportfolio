# React Portfolio

## Overview 
Created a portfolio using my new React skills, which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies. 

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
